2. **Change Management:** Managing modifications made to these components over time, ensuring controlled and documented alterations.

3. **Versioning and Release Management:** Facilitating the creation and organization of different software versions for various needs or environments.

4. **Preserving Software Quality:** Maintaining the integrity and reliability of the software configuration throughout its evolution.

In SCM, tasks align in layers, forming a structured approach:

- **SCIs Flow:** SCIs move through these layers, integrating into the software configuration of different application versions over time.
- **Layer Applicability:** Each layer implies specific actions. For instance, when a new SCI is created, it must undergo identification. However, if no changes are requested, the change control layer is unnecessary.
- **Version Assignment:** SCIs are assigned to particular software versions using version control mechanisms, maintaining detailed records for auditing and reporting purposes.

### Explain Formal Technical Review.

### What is the Objective of Formal Technical Reviews?

A formal technical review (FTR) is a software quality control activity performed by software engineers (and others).

The objectives of an FTR are:

1. To uncover errors in function, logic, or implementation for any representation of the software.
2. To verify that the software under review meets its requirements.
3. To ensure that the software has been represented according to predefined standards.
4. To achieve software that is developed in a uniform manner.
5. To make projects more manageable.

Here's a simplified and refined version:

**Review Reporting and Guidelines:**

- In an FTR, the recorder notes down all raised issues.
- These issues are summarized after the review meeting, creating a list of problems. Additionally, a formal review summary report is made.

### State the difference between procedural Design and Object Oriented Design.

| **Aspect**            | **Procedural Design**                    | **Object-Oriented Design**                                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach**          | Focuses on procedures/functions.         | Focuses on objects and their interactions.                             |
| **Data Handling**     | Data and procedures are separate.        | Emphasizes encapsulating data and methods within objects.              |
| **Reusability**       | Limited reusability of functions.        | Encourages reusability through inheritance and polymorphism.           |
| **Encapsulation**     | No inherent mechanism for encapsulation. | Supports encapsulation, hiding internal state.                         |
| **Inheritance**       | Not a prominent feature.                 | Prominent feature allowing objects to inherit properties and behavior. |
| **Example Languages** | C, Pascal                                | Java, Python, C++                                                      |

### What are functional requirements?

Functional requirements specify how a system should respond to inputs and what outputs it should generate. Identifying these requirements involves several key points:

1. **High-Level Functions:** Define basic functionalities derived from the problem statement. For instance, a Library Management System should manage book issuance and returns.

2. **User Tasks:** Identify tasks where users interact with the system to achieve specific goals, like using a "Search Book" feature in a digital library.

3. **System Inputs and Outputs:** View the system as a black box—inputs trigger outputs. For instance, providing a book title input yields book details and location as output.

4. **Detailed Requirements:** High-level requirements may have different sub-requirements. For example, the "Issue Book" module may have variations based on user classes or specific user behaviors.

### What are non-functional requirements?

- Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are distinct from functionalities, defining how the system should perform under given conditions.
- NFRs outline behavior expectations or constraints, such as the system's RAM requirements (e.g., 128MB), without specifying functionalities.
- They address aspects like performance, reliability, security, usability, scalability, and compliance, guiding system behavior and quality attributes.
- NFRs play a vital role in setting performance expectations and constraints for the system without detailing specific functionalities.

### What are the levels at which testing done?

1. **Unit Testing:** It examines individual components or modules in isolation. Developers conduct unit tests to validate the functionality of each unit of code.

2. **Integration Testing:** This assesses the interaction between different units/modules when integrated into a group. It verifies if these units function correctly when combined.

3. **System Testing:** It examines the behavior of the entire software system. It ensures that the integrated components work together as expected and meet the defined requirements.

4. **Acceptance Testing:** This is performed to verify if the software meets the business requirements and whether it is acceptable for delivery to the end-users or customers. It includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) where users validate the system's functionality.

5. **Regression Testing:** It ensures that recent changes in the code don’t negatively impact the existing functionalities. It retests the unchanged parts of the software along with the modifications.

6. **Performance Testing:** This evaluates the software's responsiveness, scalability, and stability under various conditions like load, stress, and volume to ensure it performs well under expected workloads.

7. **Security Testing:** It aims to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software to protect it against potential threats or unauthorized access.

### Define basic path testing.

- Basis Path Testing is a white-box testing method used to design test cases based on the control flow of a program. It involves analyzing the program's control structure to identify and execute the independent paths within it. The primary steps involved in Basis Path Testing include:

1. **Control Flow Graph (CFG):** Construct a Control Flow Graph representing the program's control flow. This graph illustrates the sequence of execution in the program, including loops, conditionals, and branches.

2. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Calculate the Cyclomatic Complexity of the CFG. It quantifies the independent paths through the code, providing a threshold for the number of test cases needed to cover these paths.

3. **Basis Paths:** Identify the basis set of linearly independent paths through the CFG. Each basis path represents a unique sequence of control flow within the program.

4. **Test Cases:** Develop test cases to execute each basis path. These test cases are designed to cover every independent path identified, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage.

### How to measure quality and defect removal efficiency.

1. **Defect Density:** Ratio of defects found per size of the software. It helps gauge the number of defects per unit of software size.

2. **Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE):** Measures the effectiveness of defect removal activities in the software development process. It’s calculated by dividing the total defects found before release by the total defects found before and after release.

3. **Failure Rate:** Number of failures observed during a specific period divided by the total time in that period.

4. **Code Coverage:** Percentage of code covered by tests, indicating how much of the codebase is exercised during testing.

5. **Customer Reported Defects:** Number of defects reported by customers after software release, indicating post-release issues.

6. **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** Average time between system failures.

7. **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):** Average time taken to fix defects or failures.

8. **Test Effectiveness:** Ratio of the number of defects found by tests to the total number of defects found.

### State the need for software configuration review.

Software configuration reviews are crucial for several reasons:

1. **Consistency and Compliance:** Ensure that the software configuration items adhere to established standards, policies, and guidelines.

2. **Error Identification:** Identify errors, inconsistencies, or discrepancies in the software configuration, preventing potential issues in the software product.

3. **Risk Mitigation:** Reduce the risk of deploying incorrect or outdated configurations, minimizing the chance of system failures or security vulnerabilities.

4. **Traceability:** Maintain a clear trail of changes made to configurations, facilitating easier tracking and rollback if necessary.

5. **Quality Assurance:** Ensure that the software configurations align with functional and non-functional requirements, improving the overall quality of the software product.

6. **Enhanced Collaboration:** Encourage collaboration and communication among team members involved in the configuration management process.

7. **Continuous Improvement:** Provide a basis for continuous improvement by analyzing and learning from past configurations and their effects.

### What is Coupling? What is Cohesion? Explain different types of Cohesion and Coupling with proper example. (Summer 7)

### What is coupling? Explain the various types of coupling? (Winter 7)

### What are the different types of Cohesion? (Winter 3)

### What is cohesion? Explain the various types of cohesion?

- Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between different modules or components in a software system.
- It measures how much one module relies on the functionality provided by another.
- In general, low coupling is desirable as it enhances maintainability, reusability, and flexibility in software systems.

**Types of Coupling:**

1. **Data Coupling:**

- Modules are loosely coupled if they communicate by passing minimal data between them.
- **Example:**
  - Module A sends only the necessary data to Module B without exposing its internal structure.

2. **Control Coupling:**

- Modules are coupled if one module controls the behavior of another by providing it with specific control information.
- **Example:**
  - Module A dictates the behavior of Module B by passing control flags or parameters.

3. **Common Coupling:**

- Modules are coupled if they share global data.
- **Example:**
  - Multiple modules access and modify the same global variable, leading to a high degree of interdependence.

4. **Stamp Coupling:**

- Modules are coupled if they share a composite data structure, such as a record or array, and use only a part of it.
- **Example:**
  - Module A uses the first half of a shared array, and Module B uses the second half.

5. **Content Coupling:**

- Modules are tightly coupled if one module accesses the internal details or implementation of another.
- **Example:**
  - Module A directly accesses the private variables of Module B.

**Cohesion in Software Engineering:**

- Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements (functions, classes, or modules) within a software module are related to one another.
- High cohesion is desirable as it indicates that the elements within a module are closely related and work together to achieve a specific functionality.

**Types of Cohesion:**

1. **Functional Cohesion:**

- Elements are grouped because they perform a similar function or operation.
- **Example:**
  - A module containing functions for file input, file processing, and file output.

2. **Sequential Cohesion:**

- Elements are grouped because they are executed sequentially in the same order.
- **Example:**
  - A module with steps for initializing a system, processing data, and generating a report in a fixed sequence.

3. **Communicational Cohesion:**

- Elements are grouped because they operate on the same input data or share intermediate results.
- **Example:**
  - A module with functions that all operate on the same data structure.

4. **Procedural Cohesion:**

- Elements are grouped because they contribute to a single, sequential computation.
- **Example:**
  - A module with functions for computing a specific mathematical formula.

5. **Temporal Cohesion:**

- Elements are grouped because they are executed at the same time.
- **Example:**
  - A module with functions that are all executed during a specific event or time period.

6. **Logical Cohesion:**

- Elements are grouped because they are logically related, but the specific criterion is not clearly defined.
- **Example:**
  - A module containing a mix of functions related to data manipulation.

7. **Coincidental Cohesion:**

- Elements are grouped arbitrarily with no clear relationship.
- **Example:**
  - A module that contains unrelated functions for different purposes.

### Explain with example diagram the functional and behavioral modeling. How do we model the software’s reaction to some external event?

**Functional Modeling:**

- Functional modeling involves representing what a system does, its operations, and capabilities.
- For instance, in a banking system, it would include functions like creating accounts, transferring funds, and checking balances.

**Behavioral Modeling:**

- Behavioral modeling focuses on how a system behaves in response to various events or conditions.
- For example, in a banking system, it would show the steps a user takes to transfer funds, including validations and system responses.

**Modeling Software's Reaction to External Events:**

- To model how software reacts to external events, techniques like State Transition Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams are used.

1. **State Transition Diagrams:**

- Represent how the software moves between different states based on external events. Each state reflects a mode of operation.

- Example:
  - In a ticket booking system, states could include "Selecting Seats" or "Entering Payment Details," and transitions occur based on events like "Payment Confirmation."

2. **Sequence Diagrams:**

- Illustrate interactions between objects in chronological order, depicting how the software reacts to external events over time.

- Example:
  - In an online shopping system, a sequence diagram would show how a user adds items to the cart, proceeds to checkout, and completes the purchase.

### What is Software Testing? What is the role of a Software Tester? Compare Black Box and White Box Testing.
